### Day 1: August 7, 2023 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

- Adding email collection to input field for signups on https://phoummavongchiropractic.framer.website/
- Added an redirect page after submission of signup on https://phoummavongchiropractic.framer.website/thanks

#### Thoughts

- I was able to learn more about the input field by watching this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcVlTScOo4) by Framer, thankfully. It is now working however I haven't connected a third party like Mailchimp or Loops etc. yet. So I am not exactly sure where the emails are going.
- I also used the same video to help create a redirect page with subtle effects. Framer option to Remix has been awesome and helpful.

### Day 2: August 8, 2023 - Tuesday

#### Todays's Progress

- Started working on The 777 Beauty Co Website again and was able to research designs + build out a couple sections:
- Nav bar
- About
- Services
- Testimonials
- Footer

#### Thoughts

- Used the template sections from Framer to understand how things were layered and more customization features. Finally got a design I like going that is clean yet neutral/luxury/inviting at the same time so I am really happy about that. Here is the color palette using the initial logo + adding an action color
  Primary: Snow
  Secondary: Coffee
  Action: Moss Green
  Text: Black (using for accessibiity to ensure color contrast)

- I also looked at the existing Carousel and thought that might be a good idea for showcasing the services! The [demo](https://www.framer.com/learn/how-to-add-a-carousel/) and then my implementation: <img width="699" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10 25 41 AM" src="https://github.com/jasminepvo/code-journal/assets/99847030/341a059f-8eb3-4b0a-97ac-41e48728c594">

- I am also happy with the testimonials section:
