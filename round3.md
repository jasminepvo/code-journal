### Day 1: August 7, 2023 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

- Adding email collection to input field for signups on https://phoummavongchiropractic.framer.website/
- Added an redirect page after submission of signup on https://phoummavongchiropractic.framer.website/thanks

#### Thoughts

- I was able to learn more about the input field by watching this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcVlTScOo4) by Framer, thankfully. It is now working however I haven't connected a third party like Mailchimp or Loops etc. yet. So I am not exactly sure where the emails are going.
- I also used the same video to help create a redirect page with subtle effects. Framer option to Remix has been awesome and helpful.

### Day 2: August 8, 2023 - Tuesday

#### Todays's Progress

- Started working on The 777 Beauty Co Website again and was able to research designs + build out a couple sections:
- Nav bar (30 min)
- About (30 min)
- Services (1 hour)
- Testimonials (1.5 hr)
- Footer (10 min)

#### Thoughts

- Used the template sections from Framer to understand how things were layered and more customization features. Finally got a design I like going that is clean yet neutral/luxury/inviting at the same time so I am really happy about that. Here is the color palette using the initial logo + adding an action color
  Primary: Snow
  Secondary: Coffee
  Action: Moss Green
  Text: Black (using for accessibiity to ensure color contrast)

- I also looked at the existing Carousel and thought that might be a good idea for showcasing the services! The [demo](https://www.framer.com/learn/how-to-add-a-carousel/) and then my implementation: <img width="699" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10 25 41 AM" src="https://github.com/jasminepvo/code-journal/assets/99847030/341a059f-8eb3-4b0a-97ac-41e48728c594">

- I am also happy with the testimonials section:

### Day 3: August 9, 2023 - Wednesday

#### Todays's Progress

- Published the site and updated the site description - https://the777beautyco.framer.website/ (10 min)
- Added the footer with social media [links](https://www.framer.community/c/resources/social-media-component) (1.5 hr)
- Add [scrolling links](https://www.framer.com/learn/smooth-scrolling-links-with-scroll-targets/) using parallax to the footer (30 min)
- Add more content for services + finishing touches / cleanup to layout (2 hr)

#### Thoughts

- Getting pretty fast at understanding the rows / columns to make layouts! I'm done though. I think it looks amazing and I'm so freaking proud of myself! I can see myself easily spinning out these websites for $$$ and having fun doing so with Framer. I'll go back and add effects possibly but it's ready to send off as the first draft. Overall ~8hrs
- Oops, its not mobile optimized yet.

### Day 4: August 10, 2023 - Thursday

#### Todays's Progress

- Watched [Framer Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebtzVGVVHhA) for a better understanding on layouts (frame vs stack vs grid, relative vs fixed vs fill vs fit)
- Responsive tablet view (1.5hr)
- Mobile view (1hr)
- Nav Menu open + close (3hr)
- Updated link redirects throughout (10min)

#### Thoughts

- Frame is free positioning, stack is flex, grid is grid. If using grid and contents flow out the page, you can turn the page into a stack. Fixed for positioning anywhere. Relative takes up % of parent container. Fill will fill up a fraction of the page. Fit is auto-sizing contents to fit inside parent container. This helped me with my tablet / mobile view.
- Responsive took me a bit to learn but I got it down now
- Tablet had to change the stack for About section and Footer
- UGHHHHH spending an ungodly amount of time trying to get the nav menu working. At first, it wasn't appearing. Then it worked but I didn't like how it overlapped the logo. Now the open/close works but links are invisible

- IT HAD TO DO WITH THE PARENT CONTAINER BEING A FIXED HEIGHT AHHHHH. That was a painful 3 hours of my life.
- https://the777beautyco.framer.website/ IS DONE THOUGH YAYYYY!!! ðŸ¥³
