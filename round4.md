#### Thoughts

- Here we go again. Truth is, I prioritized my job over lifetime learning and consistency. As a new developer who just landed my first job in tech, which has been a dream of mine, I felt as if I owed my full time commitment and duty to performing as best as possible in my new role, since I was also making the most I've ever made in my life. Since then, i've learned tremendously and made an impact in that position which led me to fulfill even bigger dreams. I became a cofounder and frontend engineering lead, working with the most amazing programmer / friend currently who's doing big things at Google. I learned so much when it came to AI, backend, cloud, project mangement, marketing and all other responsiblities that come with a startup. I don't regret anything. Just looking forward to getting back to consistently coding/learning!
- Codewars was a good refresher on .replace() and regex

- Also can't forget about my daily css battle. A heart is just 2 circles overlapping a square at 45deg.
