# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 77%. Just finished the Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript to be played using prompt feature and results displayed in the console. 

**Thoughts** I am used to C++ so learning different syntax and having to console.log to test is interesting.

### Day 2: May 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 81%. Completed JavaScript Basics - Lesson 8: Clean Code, Lesson 9: Installing Node.js. Began Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4(Arrays)

**Thoughts** Being someone who is OCD and very detail oriented, clean code will be very easy for me. This reminds me of my first CS course I ever took where my professor graded the first program extremely hard on indentation, capitalization, syntax etc. and most of the class failed but I got a 100! Also started on arrays and loops in JS. Arrays are easy but loops are different than C++ in my opinion

### Day 3: May 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 81%. Completed JavaScript Basics - Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4(Loops, Test Driven Development, Practice Problem: helloWorld, repeatString, reverseString, removeFromArray).

**Thoughts** Good refresher of for and while loops. I was able to easily code the practice problems on paper and match up to the solution. Thoughts on individual exercises:  
helloWorld - simple test  
repeatString - pretty simple for loop  
reverseString - although there are other methods, it's cool JavaScript has built in methods to split, reverse and join that make the solution simple. Otherwise would have to use a decrementing for loop or recursion  
removeFromArray - learned how rest parameters syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array and then used the filter method to iterate through the array and pass values that return true into a new, filtered array

### Day 4: June 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 85%. Completed JavaScript Basics - Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4(Practice Problems: sumAll, leapYears, tempConversion), Lesson 11: DOM Manipulation and Events

**Thoughts** Love the idea behind this lesson with test driven development. I have always tested as I code because it just makes sense to make sure it works before moving on instead of testing at the end and spending way more time to debug.  

sumAll - love coding out on paper first to work through the iteration and drawing diagrams  
leapYears - forgot what leap year was until now (divisible by 4 and not 100), used if statement with &&  
tempConversion - converting farenheit to celcius and vice versa. I remember writing this in C++. Just need the correct formula and be careful with parenthesis. Also use math.round() * 10 / 10 to include 1 decimal point.

### Day 5: June 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 87%. Completing JavaScript Basics - Lesson 11: Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors 

**Thoughts** It was cool to take my game played in console only and add simple UI to it. Also learned how to branch in Git to work on the new feature without breaking my original code and then merge back!

### Day 6: June 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 87%. Completed JavaScript Basics - Lesson 11: Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors. Started JavaScript Basics - Lesson 12: Etch-A-Sketch Project

**Thoughts** Found typos in my hml file so I madde corrections and when I tried to push my code, I ran into this: 
  
`hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.`

Love the hints, pretty straightforward fix just listening to the hints. I solved this by using git pull -> git add to update the current branch, git commit -m " ", git push origin main

This image was helpful too:     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99847030/172021752-acbd1f4d-53c2-410e-8fd3-f0f4a1d427de.png)

Happy with my project and wanted to update it to my portfolio website ðŸ˜Š
